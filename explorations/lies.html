            <h1>The Anatomy of a Lie</h1>
<h2>January 2018</h2>

<i>L, if you are reading this: I am so sorry.</i><br><br>


<p>On November 8, 2014, I learned that my long-distance boyfriend of one year, "Ad," was not who he said he was. In addition to adopting a completely fake name, he had dubbed me, and dozens before me, an unknowing other-woman to his wife of five years. What Ad didn't realize, however, was that he was helping me document his lies the whole time.</p>

<p>Unlike many catfishing scenarios (but not unlike many affairs), we regularly saw each other face-to-face, despite me living in Chicago and Ad in Boston. We had met through an online community, and his "identity" was corroborated by numerous mutual friends that we'd both met off-screen. Ad was well-known and well-liked and had even dated several people I knew. It never would have occurred to me that he wasn't real.</p>


<h3>Long-Distance Visits</h3>

<div class="caption">Despite a thousand miles of distance (and his wife),<br>we spent
an average of 20% of each month together.</div>

<p>Though we dated for a full year and were friends for months before, I only knew Ad at the tail end of his existence. He had been fabricated three years earlier -- a desperate, haphazard, and ingenious solution to the social and sexual isolation he felt in his marriage.</p>

<p>Operating under the assumption that "what you don't know can't hurt you," Real Ad began looking for ways to get his dissatisfaction out of his system. With the main goal of protecting his identity, Ad was designed to be manageable rather than attractive or successful. He had the same degree, but from a less prestigious school. He was younger, but only by a year.</p>

<p>Expecting to use the persona to find quick and detached one-night-stands, Real Ad was surprised when his pursuits led him to genuine connections. Finding himself socially satisfied for the first time since settling down, he was reluctant to let go of his newfound relationships. Over time, he courted more than one hundred women from online dating websites, keeping the romance casual but indulging in the companionship and community that was newly available to him.</p>

<div class="caption">Ad and me on a trip in Venice. He wouldn't let me post pictures of his face <br> to social media, so we would get creative with shadows and reflections.</div>


<p>The longer Ad existed, the bigger his network grew, and the more elaborate his backstory and excuses became. To explain why he could never invite women or friends to his house, he invented an ex-fiancee named Katie. He and "Katie" had bought a house together when they were “engaged.” She ostensibly moved out when they split up, but moved back in a few years later for financial reasons.</p>

<p>Ad insisted their relationship was civil and platonic, that they were just roommates. I suspected there was more to it, but didn't feel like it was my business. My relationship with Ad began casually, just like all his others. Sure, we visited each other every month and delighted in each other's company, but with a ten-year, thousand-mile gap between us,
