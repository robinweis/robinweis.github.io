            <h1>Friday Nights in 2013 and 2014</h1>
            <h2>August 15, 2015</h2>

            My New Year&apos;s Resolution in 2013 was to write down at least one thing every day that made me smile. The happiness log that began as a piece of paper taped to the wall next to my bed has since blossomed into a beautiful series of Google spreadsheets that contains damn near everything &mdash; the good, the bad, and the ugly.
            <br /><br /><br>

            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/examplelog.png" />
            <br /><br>

            The data that I collect is far from structured or sophisticated. The easiest thing you can do with raw text is analyze word counts and frequencies, so let&apos;s start there. How much did I write in 2013 and 2014?

            <br><br>
            <h3 class="label">Average Words per Entry over Time</h3>
            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/wordsperentry.PNG" />
            <br /><br>

            I was committed to minimalism for a pretty long time. At first, circumstance was to blame. Trying to form a new habit + handwriting entries = an unsurprising average of 14 words per day. I switched to electronic logs at the beginning of 2014 but continued to keep them short and sweet until I got the itch to elaborate in March. The busyness and excitement associated with graduation becomes evident as June approaches, and then BAM &mdash; word count skyrockets when I ship myself off to Europe in July. The volume of content tapers once I return stateside in September, until I experience a particularly traumatic breakup in November. Naturally, my instinct is to document everything in meticulous, painstaking detail, and the spike in the graph is the fruit of those efforts.
            <br /><br />

            I never really had a plan for what to do with the rest of the data. I mostly wanted the logs for reference and memory&#45;jogging, because my brain does pretty good when you feed it a little context. But it just so happens that OkCupid, the free online dating site that most of the people reading this are probably familiar with, has a profile question about typical Friday nights. The day I realized I could answer that question with data was a beautiful day indeed. This was in early 2014.
            <br /><br /><br>

            <img id="okc" src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/okc.png" />
            <br /><br>

            I isolated my Fridays and read through the entries a bunch of times to get a sense of the types of things I was doing. It turned out that each evening could be described pretty nicely by three criteria &mdash; who I was with, what I was doing, and where I was doing it. After a little more information architecture witchcraft and many long hours on Excel and Microsoft Paint, I managed to produce this pretty bugger (viewable in full size <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vEhD091.png">here</a>):
            <br /><br /><br>

            <img id="x2013" src="http://i.imgur.com/vEhD091.png" />
            <br /><br />

            I was particularly interested in how my Fridays would change after I was legally allowed to drink. I didn&apos;t care enough about drinking to, say, acquire a fake ID, but I was SO excited to be able to go to meetups at bars, 21+ concerts and events, etc. I wondered if there would be a change in who I hung out with, or where we went, or how much I imbibed, since drinking is such a huge part of culture here.
            <br /><br />

            Before I turned 21, if I had any alcohol at all on a Friday, I was certainly binge drinking. After I turned 21, if I was out at a bar, I almost never had more than a drink or two. Being a zero&#45;income college student whose closest friends were largely still under 21, I didn&apos;t see the point in going to bars with people I&apos;d be hanging out with anyway and ordering a bunch of drinks that cost four times as much as they would at home. I continued to drink heavily at parties, however.
            <br /><br />

            Another interesting observation about 2013 is that I never spent a Friday entirely alone. Even if you subtract the time I spent shut in my room on Google Hangouts with internet friends, I always had some form of face&#45;to&#45;face interaction with people beyond the friends I was living with. Though the same probably wasn&apos;t true for Saturdays or Sundays or Wednesdays, my Fridays appear to have been more outgoing than my perception would have pinned them to be.
            <br /><br />

            When 2014 came to a close, I was really excited to see how it compared to 2013. I thought the who/what/where categorization was very effective, so I stuck with it again. This time, I employed some of my newfound programming skills to make the visualization a bit more interactive. That chart can be found <a href=http://www.robinwe.is/visualizations/fridaynights2014.html>here</a>. But this is what it looks like static:
            <br /><br />

            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/2014.PNG" />
            <br />

            2014 was a year of significant change. I graduated from college, spent 3 months traveling (mostly alone), and started my first Big Kid job. I figured that my Friday nights would be drastically different in each of those phases, so I delineated them on the timeline. The only surprising thing about the subsections is how little changed about my life after I started working. I was finally living in the city proper, but the people I spent time with on Friday nights weren&apos;t drastically different.
            <br /><br />

            Even with the tweaks I employed to make the Fridays 2014 chart easier to read, it still requires a bit of work to answer questions like who I ate the most dinners with, what I did when I was hanging out with my family, or where I was when I&apos;d go out to dinner. Turns out heat maps are good for that sort of thing, even though they lose the ability to look at change over time.
            <br /><br /><br />

            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/heatmap.png" />
            <br />

            <b>How to read:</b> choose a row on the y&#45;axis. The darker the cells along the x&#45;axis, the more often I did X on Friday nights when I was already doing Y. If we choose "homework" on the y&#45;axis, we can see that I had a drink or two every night I stayed in to focus on school. But if you choose "drink (1&#45;2)" on the y&#45;axis, we see that I barely ever did homework on nights I was having a drink or two. Doing homework? Probably drinking. Drinking? Probably not doing homework. It&apos;s easy to get confused when making these distinctions, but the chart is not symmetrical, so the way it&apos;s read is important.
            <br /><br />

            I walked most frequently when I was traveling, I drank the most when I was with friends of friends and people I met online, I drank frequently when I was with my significant other but never very much, I always saw my family when I was in my hometown, and I exclusively hung out with my high school friends in the city, even though many of them lived in my hometown at the time. Furthermore, I did the most diverse set of activities with my college friends and my family, whereas I only ever drank with colleagues, and much of the time I spent with high school friends was just bumming around.
            <br /><br />

            I hope everyone realizes that despite the numbers and analyses and fancy graphs, every little inch of this is constructed with subjectivity and bias. The Friday charts by no means paint a full picture of a True Friday Night, just an overview of the people, places, and activities I chose to include. We can learn a lot by analyzing both the qualitative and quantitative changes in categories between 2013 and 2014.
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Qualitative Differences in "Who"</h3>
            In 2014, I made fewer distinctions between my friend groups in college, which was reflective of my desire to distance myself from school. On the other side of the same coin, I made more distinctions between my Chicago&#45;based friend groups, who I hung out with more often.
            <br /><br />

            I also created a distinction for romantic interest and significant other because non&#45;monogamy became a much more important part of my life in 2014. I spent most of 2013 single, so there wouldn&apos;t have been much of a need to differentiate anyway.
            <br /><br />

            Ever curious to investigate how my behavior changes around different groups of people, I also created a distinction between strangers (people who I didn&apos;t know and didn&apos;t expect to see again) and friends of friends (people who I didn&apos;t know but wasn&apos;t anonymous around).
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Quantitative Differences in "Who" </h3>
            <br>
            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/who.PNG" />
            <br />

            I spent WAY more time hanging out with people I was dating, more time by myself, and less time with pretty much everyone else. My college friends felt the most drastic difference (of the 24 college&#45;phase&#45;Fridays, I spent nearly half off&#45;campus and only 10 with college friends), followed only by my online friends, who I stopped doing Friday night Hangouts with altogether. My family and hometown friends took sizeable hits, too.
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Qualitative Differences in "What" </h3>
            In 2014, I created a category for "personal projects" that could include 2013 labels like "writing" and "crafting" and also things like working on this website or doing data analysis. I also created categories for homework, shopping, errands, walking, and phone calls/facetime &#45; apparently I became more comfortable spending my Friday nights doing less wild and more calm/adult/responsible things.
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Quantitative Differences in "What" </h3>
            <br>
            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/what.PNG" />
            <br />

            I binge drank significantly less in 2014 and casually drank significantly more. All in all, I was drinking on more unique nights, but probably less total alcohol. I also went out to eat much more often, and spent less Friday nights having unstructured quality time with people (which seemed to compose about half of what I did in 2013).
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Qualitative Differences in "Where" </h3>
            There isn&apos;t anything super profound here. In 2014, I decided to distinguish the regions of Chicago I was hanging out in. When I was still in school, if I trekked to the city, I was more likely to stick to the North side due to proximity. When I moved to the Northwest side, I was unsurprisingly more likely to spend time nearby, but I traveled North more often than I expected (including trips back to my college town).
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Quantitative Differences in "Where" </h3>
            <br>
            <img src="http://www.robinwe.is/explorations/fridays1314/where.PNG" />
            <br />

            I spent waaaay more Fridays traveling in 2014 (long&#45;distance relationship + summer travels) and waaaay less Fridays in my college town (school year ended in June and I promptly moved away). Nothing surprising there.
            <br /><br />

            As always, the fact that I create these graphs says more about my life than the graphs themselves, but I&apos;m nevertheless excited for the next year of analysis.
            <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
