        <h2>Illustrating the Future of the Company</h2>

<p>I participated in a large-scale research initiative to learn about the needs of customers, the pain points of employees, and the technology that could transform an operation. The research was summarized by a book of infographics, which was used to spark conversations with thousands of employees about the future of the company.</p>

</div>


<p>I was responsible for the production of five of these infographics. My objective was to make each poster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inviting (easy to read; aesthetically appealing)</li>
<li>Inspiring (get employees excited about the future of the company)</li>
<li>Educational (what do we have to show for weeks of research?)</li>
<li>Inclusive (account for different levels of knowledge and expertise)</li>
<li>Versatile (one version that can be published both in print and online)</li>
</ul>

<p>My role and level of involvement varied drastically from graphic to graphic, from on-the-ground research to hands-off design guidance. At the end of the research period, I was an editor of the compilation.</p>


<div class="photos">

</div>

<p>Due to the highly confidential nature of this research, I cannot show the details of the final products, but am happy to talk about my roles and approach.</p>

<br>
<div class="anchor" id="statistics"></div>
<h2>Customer Statistics</h2>

<p>The purpose of the first infographic was to "quantify" our customers using Nicholas Felton's work as inspiration. Many of the other topics had specific research objectives, and the freedom we were given was both a blessing and a curse. I worked with three other people to come up with the content and took the lead on design.</p>

<p>We began by outlining different ways we could approach the graphic. Alternatives included a customer journey map, a composition of our customers, a version of our website that would conveys customer journeys via their clicks, and a hodgepodge of charts and numbers.</p>

<!--<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/qcsketch4.jpg">-->
</div>


<p>We decided that a compilation of statistics was superior to any kind of central graphic because it would give us the freedom to showcase the most interesting facts without worrying too much about how they're all related. Now we just needed to figure out which facts were worth including.</p>

<p>We ran a bunch of queries to get usage statistics about our customers in aggregate, while also researching actual customers to create insightful company profiles. We made word clouds of customer feedback, charts exploring purchasing behavior, maps of customer locations, and so on, to help us figure out what data was most compelling.</p>

<p class="caption">Experimenting with different layouts and types of information.</p>

<p>There was a tension between the content that our team found interesting and the content that our reviewers found relevant. We were looking for relatively novel information that would help us connect to and appreciate our customers (like what their names are, and how often individuals interacted with us), while our reviewers nudged us towards customer behavior statistics that were more actionable, but also already widely understood (like which products customers are most likely to search for).</p>

<p>As a compromise, we started with the facts that our reviewers wanted to include, and sought to <i>convey</i> them in ways that would help employees feel a connection to the customers. We used half of the real estate to describe our customers in aggregate, and the other half to describe our relationship a single customer using the same metrics, with additional visualizations that would bring individuals to life. This allowed readers to compare the micro view to the macro view, and to imagine deviations that might exist with other customers. </p>

<p class="caption">We chose metrics like website traffic, session length, and types of interactions for different roles.</p>

<p>At the exhibition, the poster was accompanied by an interactive dashboard that provided real-time usage statistics. Employees loved the exhibit and enjoyed the personification of our customers.</p>

<div class="anchor" id="technology"></div>
<h2>Warehouse Technology</h2>

<p>For this project, I joined a team that had spent months researching a new technology that could automate a manual task. I watched videos, listened to specifications and sales negotiations, attended site visits, and collaborated with supervisors across the company to understand the potential impact of this new technology.</p>

<p>The team was confident that the company should pursue the technology, but doing so would displace existing warehouse jobs (years from now, but still). The challenge, therefore, was to create a poster that would convince stakeholders of the cost and efficiency savings, without introducing cause for employees to worry about their job security.</p>

<p>After exploring several ideas, we decided to introduce the technology in a <em>people-centered</em> way, highlighting the new role that the technology would create.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">We discarded ideas that focused too much on either changes to technology or roles, hoping to strike a more equitable balance.</p>

<p>We accomplished this by introducing a hierarchy: a central image would showcase the new technology from afar, creating a sense of something new and grandiose. On the next level, several circles functioned like magnifying glasses to highlight benefits and nuances of the new process, featuring both automated and manual work. The biggest circle celebrated the new manual role, and offered yet another layer of description and imagery to help employees picture themselves doing the new tasks.</p>

<div class="anchor" id="tax"></div>
<h2>Tax Compliance</h2>

<p>Tax laws affect many aspects of the operation -- where it can advertise, where employees can attend conferences or work remotely -- but they are poorly understood by employees who aren't required to interpret the legislation. The purpose of this poster was to educate employees on the complexity of the tax landscape and the nature of the company's risk aversion. I worked with a beginner designer on the conceptual and stylistic aspects of the infographic, but let her take charge of the illustration.</p>

<p>At the onset, our team of tax experts was fairly attached to a linear timeline showcasing the development of tax laws and the change in federal tax revenue over time. This approach offered a rich and data-driven history, but I felt strongly that the <i>future</i> of tax law offered a more compelling story. Tax legislation is still catching up to the phenomenon of ecommerce, and the company was preparing for the number of ways that the tax landscape could change.</p>



<div class="photos">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxgraph.jpg">
</div>

<p>I encouraged the team to consider other options to propose to their reviewers: non-linear timelines and storyboards that were more narrative in nature. Gauging the team's reactions to these alternatives helped me understand what kind of information they cared the most about showing.</p>

	

<div class="photos thumbnails-medium">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxoption1.jpg">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxoption2.jpg">
</div>

<p>The team liked the non-linear timeline, and be began thinking of themes, metaphors, and gamifications that could make the graphic more inviting (people's eyes seem to glaze over at the mere mention of taxes). We kept returning to Western themes, because tax law is often referred to as the "Wild West."</p>


<div class="photos">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxwwdraft.jpg">
</div>

<p>The team embraced the new theme, but the timeline still felt kind of dry. I thought of ways we could run with the Wild West idea. I pitched the idea of a comic strip:</p>

		

<div class="photos thumbnails-small">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxcomic1.jpg">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxcomic2.jpg">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/taxcomic3.jpg">
</div>

<p>The reviewers liked it, but felt it was too complicated. That's when one of the team members came up with the idea for one wholistic, cartoony "shootout" scene that would convey the chaos of the tax laws. The other teammates were excited about it, so we all picked up our pencils and began to flesh out some metaphors.</p>

<p>The audience would first be drawn to a standoff between states and companies, who are lobbing tax laws at each other in the form of paper airplanes. The sheriff of the town -- the federal government -- is asleep in a rocking chair, representing the way the fed has yet to take a stance on ecommerce tax laws. Our company is, importantly, a bystander who is impacted by this brawl, and not an active participant. A wagon full of supplies represent the ways the company is preparing for a tax landscape that is changing in uncertain ways.</p>

<p>Once we got the go-ahead from our reviewers, I worked with our illustrator to determine the size, layout, and number of features. I encouraged her to take the lead, and pointed out ways she could simplify things or strengthen the story.</p>

</div>


<p class="caption">The designer's pitch (left) and my simplified version (right).</p>

<p>When we felt good about the sketches, our illustrator transitioned to a higher fidelity mockup. After she pulled a draft together, I stepped in to make some stylistic suggestions.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Before and after my style suggestions.</p>

<p>The poster was a huge hit at the poster exhibition. Employees said they learned a lot and didn't realize the laws were so fuzzy. People remembered the punchline rather than the metaphor, referring to the project as "the tax poster" rather than "the western poster" (which was not the case for many of the other projects). All in all, we were successful in putting the fun in tax laws.</p>

<br>
<div class="anchor" id="warehouse"></div>
<h2>Warehouse Workflow</h2>

<p>I was asked to redesign an infographic about a new material processing that fell short of reviewers' expectations. The reviewers felt that the existing design was too specific, and failed to convey the grand and exciting scale of a new technology. </p>


<div class="photos">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rroriginal.png">
</div>

<p class="caption">The existing design focused too much on a hypothetical workstation, when the process significantly affected several components of the operation.</p>

<p>To begin, I read up on the team's research and looked through design iterations to understand the team's approach to the story. Once I got the gist of the technology, it was clear that the first design was actually on the right track, and all we needed to do was take a step back and incorporate more of the benefits to the new process.</p>


		

<div class="photos thumbnails-small">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrsketch1.png">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrsketch2.png">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrsketch3.png">
</div>


<p>I sought to do this by simply illustrating a greater portion of the workflow. The reality of the new process was a little too detailed for our audience, so I made a series of abstractions that simplified the process while still conveying the most important details. The reviewers were onboard with the abstractions, so I began to think about how to best illustrate the new flow.</p>




<div class="photos thumbnails-small">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrdraft1.png">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrdraft2.png">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrdraft3.png">

<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrdraft5.png">
<img src="http://robinwe.is/portfolio/infographics/rrdraft6.png">
</div>

<p>Before long, we became attached to the idea of an isometric illustration. The rest of the work was a matter of trimming and placing copy and creating a natural hierarchy that accurately followed the workflow. In the end, we managed to put information in proximity to the illustrations, while making the new process both exciting and easy to follow.</p>


<br>
<div class="anchor" id="delegation"></div>
<h2>Work Delegation System</h2>

<p>Less than a week before the final deadline for all of the infographics, I was asked if I could salvage a poster that had significant structural problems. The file was so big that it wouldn't display correctly when opened as a PDF, which was just one symptom of it's unnecessarily complex design. The infographic was chaotic and the story unclear.</p>

<p>I didn't have time to do the thorough research and ideation that I did with the other topics, so I did the best I could with the time I had. I quickly redrew the assets (which were also corrupted) to create a cohesive feel and did as much as I could to simplify the design while preserving as many of the original designer's ideas as possible. The main changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing details that didn't add value</li>
<li>Using the freed up space to make everything bigger and more legible</li>
<li>Integrating descriptions with their visual components so that relevant information was in closer proximity</li>
</ul>

<p>The tweaks were approved without any fuss, the reviewers were thrilled by the fast turnaround, and the poster was able to be a part of the exhibition. </p>
